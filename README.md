# Rainbow-Poem
This is a repo for my rainbow poem.
The unicorn says this is how you make a rainbow
First you need half a sky full of clouds
All rumbly and grumbly
Then you you need the other half full of sunshine
All bright a d full of light
Now you have a sky full of colors
All the fairies have come to play
